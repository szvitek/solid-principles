## 1 Single responsibility principle (SRP)

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should only have one job.

## 2 Open closed principle (OCP)

Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## 3 Liskov substitution principle (LSP)

According to the Liskov substitution principle, subclasses should be interchangeable with their base classes.

## 4 Interface segregation principle (ISP)

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## 5 Dependency Inversion principle (DIP)

Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
